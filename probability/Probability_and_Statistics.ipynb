    "Lets say we have a classification problem with three classes C1, C2 and C3, we fit a machine learning model M to the train data set. From the test data set we pick up a query point and pass it through model M. Using probability theory, we can get class probabilites for the query point,  having class probabilites is intutitive and interpretable. \n",
