    "Lets say we have a classification problem with three classes C1, C2 and C3, we fit a machine learning model M to the train data set. From the test data set we pick up a query point and pass it through model M. Using probability theory, we can get class probabilites for the query point,  having class probabilites is intutitive and interpretable. \n",

    "### Random Variable ($X$)\n",
    "$X$ is said to be random variable if the value of $X$ is a function whose domain is same as the probability experiment with finite (countably infinte) outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: let our proability experiment be roll of fair die. The sample space is {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Random variable $X$ will be {1,2,3,4,5,6} any value less than 1 or greater than 6 cannot be part of set $X$. \n",

    "Example: let our proability experiment be toss of fair coin. The sample space is {H,T}. Random variable $X$ will be {H,T} any value other than H or T, cannot be part of set $X$. \n",

    "### Guassian/Normal Probability Distribution\n",
    "* Often used in natural (height and weight of people, flower sizes etc) and social sciences, this distribution is useful in representing random variable whose distributions are not known. \n",
    "* This distribution has this form $X$= $N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$, where $\\mu$ is mean and $\\sigma^2$ is variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula\n",
    "$$P(X=x)=\\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{\\left(-\\frac{{\\left(x - \\mu\\right)}^{2}}{2 \\, \\sigma^{2}}\\right)} $$\n",

    "As $x$ moves aways from $\\mu$ the probability reduces exponentially\n",

    "**CDF of Gaussian Distribution**\n",
    "* CDF can help us in determinig if the probability of a random value from the population will be greater than certain value or between two values \n",
    "* CDF is useful in calculating the p-value, p-value = 1 - CDF\n",
    "* Lets say we have a water bottle company, we produce 2 liter bottles. if we pick one bottle at random, using CDF we can tell if the fill weight ( 2 lit ~ 4.4 pounds) is less than 4 pounds or between certain value or greater than certain value. \n",

    "**Standard Normal Variate**\n",

    "* Random variable with $\\mu=0$ and standard deviation=1\n",
    "* Column standardization - convert any normal distribution to standard normal variate $\t\\forall x $ in a given column subtract $\\frac {x_i-\\mu}{\\sigma}$\n",
    "* Useful to control the scale or the variability of the dataset\n",
    "* non standardized values in a column can affect clustering algos \n",
    "* if features with small values contribute to class seperability then feature with a larger value will overshadow the effects of the feature with a smaller value leading to incorrect predictions\n",

    "### Sampling Distribution & Central Limit Theorm \n",
    "\n",
    "* Let $X$ be a random variable from any distribution has a finite $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$, then if you collect enough samples from that unknown or known distribution then the mean of the sampling distribution will be a normal gaussian distribution. \n",
    "![scatter_plot_iris](../images/clt.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rule of thumb the number of samples you should collect should be ~ 30 \n",
    "* Applications\n",
    "    * we can use the mean of sampling distribution to create confidence intervals\n",
    "    * useful in T-tests (difference between two sample means)\n",
    "    * useful in ANOVA (difference between more than two sample means)\n",
    "    * Can be used in noise cancellation \n",
    "    * The probability distribution for total distance covered in a random walk (biased or unbiased) will tend toward a normal distribution.\n",
