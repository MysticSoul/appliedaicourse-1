    "\n",
    "- Histogram is a frequency count of points, typically we the data is broken into buckets (binning/bucketing), ex if you have age as a features and we have 100 people, we can count number of people in age group 10-20, 21-30, 31-40 etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Smooth form of histogram is called probability density function, the process of smoothing out histogram is called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)\n",

    "- Area under PDF is always one \n",

    "- PDF's gives estimation of high and low density data points \n",

    "- PDF for continous random variable, Probability Mass Function for discrete random variable\n",
    "- PDF's are used for calculating probabilites for a range not at individual point as the AUC is zero.\n",

    "* Helpful in identifying feature importance in a classification problem, example in the figure below we have three features F1, F2 and F3 and three classes C1, C2 and C3. The plots are pdfs of all the three features. We can clearly see that Feature1 is most important (and has the maximum variance) since it can clearly serperate the classes \n",
