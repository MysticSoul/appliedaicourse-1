# Exploratory Data Analysis



#### 1- First steps when you get a new dataset?

* How many data points/row count/observations are there?
* What are the headers/column names/column descriptions
* What is the type of the data set
* What is the preliminary objective of the dataset - if classification then - 
  * How many classes
  * Is there class imbalance 

* NAN/Missing values 

* Extereme values 

* Incomplete data entries or rows 

* Range of each column, acceptable range 

* Who is giving us the data - *can we trust them?*

* How to check if we received all the data 

* Perform column analysis

* What is the refresh rate of the data

  * Is this data one time lookup or one time dump

  * If we receive it at a regular clip, what is the frequency - s, mm, hr, dd, qtr, yyyy

  * What is the volume/size of the transmit

  * What is the velocity/rate - batch or real time or near real time 


### 2-Basic Plots 

 **Scatter Plot** 

* Good to identify relationships between columns 
* Pari plots, pair wise scatter plots for more than three dimensions 
* If a straight line can seperate the classes correctly then the data set is called linearly seperable
